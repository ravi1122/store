# C2: Creating home page (header, body and footer)

- ### As we are using Bootstrap as our CSS-Framework we need to use their classes

- ### For SVG icons - [FontAwesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

## Create three sections in a page

1. ### Header

- Go to [Bootstrap site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/) and choose your header style.
- Update the layout to match your design
- Brand Logo
- - The brand logo can be simple brand name with different font or can be image or both.
- - Here we will use both image (svg icon from FontAwesome and Brand name in `pacifico` font)
- - To add font to our site add its link to the html file.
- - Refer [this](https://designshack.net/articles/css/the-10-best-script-and-handwritten-google-web-fonts/) for site name to get most famous and stylish free fonts.
- Search Box
- - Update the search box properties as per your requirements.
- Nav menu
- - Update menu options as per your requirement

2. ### Body

- There will be nothing in the body for this session

3. ### Footer

- There is not much about the `footer` on the Bootstrap, so we'll create our own footer with Bootstrap styles.
- Create simple `row` with `4 col` with different widths - as per design
- Add the child elements to each column.
- Add the CSS to match the design.

## Verify

- Your new header should match with your design
- Your new footer should match with your design
